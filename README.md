This web application was created to simulate a real world bank application transfer between users
There are four users in this bank app.
User1 username : su   User1 pin: 1111
User2 username : td   User2 pin: 2222
User3 username : va   User3 pin: 3333
User4 username : so   User4 pin: 4444

By using JavaScript to define the fucntionalities of the client-side, features such as a difference currencies for different regions, a timer that logs users out after a certain period     and many more.

Inspiration for this project came from The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22648779#overview)

In further commits, I will be adding the feature that allows users to sign up and create their own custom account
